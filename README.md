## Running the App
**First**, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" with your App ID.

```
<string name="agora_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
```

**Next**, integrate the Agora Video SDK:

Download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/downloads). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**.

**Finally**, open project with Android Studio, connect your Android device, build and run.

Or use `Gradle` to build and run.
